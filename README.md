Currently working on:

- an in-browser file tree & content editor with content nesting & static spin-off, in React & Node.js with a RESTful API
- the next stage of the demo model for [thru.js](https://github.com/barcek/thru.js), to generate a full stack app using Express.js & TypeScript
- more options for handling DOM trees in [awb](https://github.com/barcek/awb), fp resources in Python for [phns](https://github.com/barcek/phns) & entries for [notes](https://barcek.github.io/notes)
- a back end module in TypeScript to take & extend formatting logic in the [rhizo](https://github.com/barcek/rhizo) Vue components
- a cross-project stylesheet for development, extending those in [docNxgres](https://github.com/barcek/docNxgres) & notes
- a browser extension to wrap citations with site context

Longer-term projects:

- a dual-access approach to the service layer in Node.js, also spun off from a full stack [augomate](https://barcek.github.io/augomate)
- a command-line cross-file word synchronizer, initially for CSS class names, in TypeScript
- a plugin method for [sprk](https://github.com/barcek/sprk) & plugins to support full stack web development & browsing
- other in-browser development tools: a favicon serializer & a syntax highlighter
- a lightweight single-page web app framework with transpilation optional
- a containerized process hub, in Python & TypeScript
