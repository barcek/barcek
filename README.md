Currently working on:

- a dual-access approach to the service layer in Node.js, also spun off from a full stack [augomate](https://barcek.github.io/augomate)
- an extension of [sprk](https://github.com/barcek/sprk) supporting full stack web development
- a single-page, more tightly hypertextual blog-like resource, initially using Vue
- an elementary cross-project stylesheet for development templating
- a lightweight single-page web app framework
- a process hub, in Python & JS
- a favicon serializer
